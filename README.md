# The Hangman Game

Here you are going to find the Hangman Game ddeveloped in two different programming languages. One is Python, multiparadigm, and the other one is Java, OO.

For both projects the rules of the game are the same. The computer is the one who is going to think of a work and the user has to guess it. The computer will be asking the user the guesses through CLI. The user will only have 7 attempts.
