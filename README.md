# The Hangman Game

Here you are going to find the Hangman Game developed in two different programming languages. One is Python, multiparadigm, and the other one is Java, OO.

## Game rules

For both projects the rules of the game are the same. The computer is the one who is going to think of a word and the user has to guess it. The computer will be asking the user's guesses through CLI. The user will only have 7 attempts. The user can introduce a letter or a word, if the user introduces a letter two times in the same input it would be considered as a word (i.e. aa would be considered a word).

## Design

The game was requested to be done in Python a multi-paradigm language and Java an OO one. As these two languages can be very different, I decided to develop the game in both languages to see the main difference between paradigms. In Java language I applied good practices and followed the software principles while using some testing techniques. Taking the advantages of OO programming languages the game was developed like a game machine so the code is modular and easy to scale. With a Game Machine the addition of new games and their logics is easier. On the other hand, for Python, I decided to just develop the game in the easiest way possible to compare the relation quality-cost between an easy script in Python with a more scalable product in Java.

## Conclusion

The development in Python was faster and easier but more difficult to upgrade, change or scale. Also, the addition of new functionalities apart from breaking changes can bring a code really difficult to understand for someone who has never read it before. On the other hand, in Java the development of the Game took more time on thinking about the design than developing it. In the Java version you can add new features or change the existing ones without causing too much trouble and without changing the actual code. Once the code was developed it looked easier to understand than in Python. In addition the Java part was developed using test techniques which ensures the correct behavior of the game.
