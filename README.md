# The Hangman Game

Here you are going to find the Hangman Game developed in two different programming languages. One is Python, multiparadigm, and the other one is Java, OO.

## Game rules

For both projects the rules of the game are the same. The computer is the one who is going to think of a word and the user has to guess it. The computer will be asking the user's guesses through CLI. The user will only have 7 attempts. The user can introduce a letter or a word, if the user introduces a letter two times in the same input it would be considered as a word (i.e. aa would be considered a word).

## Design

The game was requested to be done in Python a multi-paradigm language and Java an OO one. As these two languages can be very different, I decided to develop the game in both languages to see the main difference between paradigms. In Java language I applied good practices and followed the software principles while using some testing techniques. Taking the advantages of OO programming languages the game was developed like a game machine so the code is modular and easy to scale. With a Game Machine the addition of new games and their logics is easier. On the other hand, for Python, I decided to just develop the game in the easiest way possible to compare the relation quality-cost between an easy script in Python with a more scalable product in Java.
