### Java Hangman Game

This is the Hangman Game developed in an OO programming languagein Java using the advantages of OOP. It uses Maven to import dependencies from another libraries for testing and another one to create random words for the computer.

Sadly the library which creates random words is not updated and has a warning from the library slf4j.

The development of the project was more situated for OO. That makes the project to be more like a Game Machine where you can have different games. In our case we will only have the Hangman Game.
